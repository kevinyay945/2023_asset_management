## Reference

### DDD

DDD comprises of 4 Layers:

1. Domain: This is where the domain and business logic of the application is defined.
2. Infrastructure: This layer consists of everything that exists independently of our application: external libraries, database engines, and so on.
3. Application: This layer serves as a passage between the domain and the interface layer. The sends the requests from the interface layer to the domain layer, which processes it and returns a response.
4. Interface: This layer holds everything that interacts with other systems, such as web services, RMI interfaces or web applications, and batch processing frontends.
